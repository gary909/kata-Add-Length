        What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?<br>
        <br>
Example(Input --> Output)<br>
<br>
"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]<br>
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]<br>
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .<br>
<br>
Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.<br>
